/**
 * Keeps a failure inside the agent from taking the page down with it.
 *
 * The agent is mounted in the root layout, on every page. An error thrown while it
 * renders would otherwise travel past every page to the global error page and
 * replace the whole site with it (finding RES-03). Caught here, only the
 * assistant is lost: the page, its navigation and a route to a person stay.
 *
 * The known trigger is outside this codebase. Browser translation rewrites the
 * text nodes React manages, and React then throws on its next update.
 *
 * The fallback is a plain link rather than a client-side one, so following it
 * reloads the app instead of carrying the broken state with it. It logs
 * nothing: the site sends no telemetry, and its privacy page says so.
